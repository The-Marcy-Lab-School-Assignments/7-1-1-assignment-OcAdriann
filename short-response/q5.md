# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

It would only match `/products/5` because `:id` is a dynamic parameter and 5 would be treated as the value of that parameter.`/products` wouldn't match because the value for `:id` is missing, `/products/apple` wouldn't match unless the route is meant to take a string, and `/products/5/about` wouldn't match because it would only match up till `products/5`.
